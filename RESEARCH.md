V4 is not deployed yet, but there is a testnet called [Conduit Testnet](https://docs.uniswapfoundation.org/overview/conduit-testnet) where we can deploy Uniswap v4 and [deploy hooks](https://docs.uniswapfoundation.org/overview/conduit-testnet/deploying-a-hook-to-the-testnet)

[v4-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/tree/main) and tutorials on [Uniswap V4 Documentation](https://docs.uniswapfoundation.org/) are made using Foundry.

To use Hardhat, you should [set it up for EIP 1153 opcodes](https://docs.uniswapfoundation.org/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment/using-hardhat-with-eip-1153)

Coded along this lesson, although I don't think I've grasped all the math:
